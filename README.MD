# Docker Container with PHP 5.4 and XDebug

# ATTENTION! We strongly suggest to NOT use this Docker image!
It is horribly outdated and we are keeping it only to ensure out compatibility claims. PHP 5.4 has been EOL since September 2015.

This is a Docker image for the Joomla CI with PHP 5.4 and XDebug 2.4.7.
