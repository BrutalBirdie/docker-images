# Docker Container with PHP 7.3

Docker Container for unit testing with PHP 7.3, XDebug 3.0.2 and our PHP Unit extensions.

Some of our dependencies still rely on Composer 1.x, so that version is installed as
a default for Composer.
If you want to check, whether the dependencies work with Composer 2.0,
use the command `composer2` instead of `composer`.
